# Introduction

This is the home page of this website/project. Other pages on this site can be linked to and this just uses markdown formatting...

I can make a table like this:

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| X     |    X  |  X    |
| X     |    X  |  X    |
| X     |    X  |  X    |

Or I can use *italics* and **bold** fonts. There is so much to markdown, even the following:

1. Numbered lists
2. Whatever goes here
3. Whatever goes here

* Bulleted lists
* Other bullet
* last bullet

# Summary

You can even create headers like what I just did here.
